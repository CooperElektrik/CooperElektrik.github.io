    <h1>Dream</h1>

    <p>
        A gentle sensation of floating that does not seem to go away engulfed the mind, leaving it in a state of breathlessness. There was no light, no warmth, nor was there anything tangible to hold onto.

        <br><br>

        Am I falling?
        
        <br><br>

        What meaningless question. "Falling" implies direction, a "down" towards which gravity relentlessly pulled oneself to. However, there was no pull, no "up", no "down". If there was no direction, then was there even space? 
        
        <br><br>

        Was I located <i>anywhere</i>? 

        <br><br>

        The "I" seemed to exist solely as this floating awareness, disconnected from any physical form, nothing more than a brain in a vat. I suppose that would explain the breathlessness: it was not from the seeming lack of air, but the shock of nothing to push against, nothing to orient by.

        <br><br>

        Ah. One could picture a glass bowl of fruit placed on a table with a bright turquoise table cloth. The oranges, impossibly round and warm-hued; the apples, their skin reflecting nothing for there was no light; the grapes, cluttered in perfect, silent bunches; all of which tilted at an awkward angle. Yes, <i>all of them</i>.

        <br><br>

        Where did that come from? It was so vivid, so <i>specific</i>, yet so illogical. How could that be? A sharp, intrusive shard of...memory? Or imagination? Perhaps, a desperate attempt by the mind to relieve itself from the utter lack of sensory input, to simply create something, anything, to look at?

        <br><br>

        It doesn't make any sense.

        <br><br>

        Must it make any sense? No.
        
        <br><br>

        Oh. It is pitch black again.

        <br><br>

        And again, there was nothing.

        <br><br>

        Ah. The bowl of fruit flickered into existence again. It is still tilted, still silent, and the cloth remained unnervingly bright in the non-existent light. Then it vanished.

        <br><br>

        No. It is still here. One could <i>feel</i> it.

        <br><br>

        Absurd. How could one <i>feel</i> it without an extension of one's body to <i>touch</i> it? The only explanation would be the "I" have gone insane.

        <br><br>

        Meaningless. Even if that was the case, it would not change the fact that it is seemingly floating in the vast expanse of the void.

        <br><br>

        Meaningless or not, the <i>feeling</i> remained. Not a physical touch, for there was nothing to touch with, but a persistent resonance. A phantom limb, on a body that never have existed in the first place. It was the <i>idea</i> of the bowl, the fruit, the cloth, impressed upon the void where "I" floated. If it could be felt, could it be explored. Tentatively, the focus shifted, trying to trace the faint contours.
        
        <br><br>

        The question hung in the nothingness, mocking itself. How could one forget? No, could one even forget? The image surged back, crashing in with the force of a tidal wave against a crumbling shore.  Was "I" looking into a mirror and thought to itself that what it saw was its reflection? That it could not be certain, as its face were blurred by the very tears that couldn't be shed, stood framed by that cascade of dark hair. It flowed without wind, without gravity, a river of midnight silk unbound by physical law.
        
        <br><br>

        Oh, <i>look</i> at the clock. It is time for the "I" to depart from this void.
